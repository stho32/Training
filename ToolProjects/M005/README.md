# M005 "prov" - Provisioning Toolset

A comprehensive infrastructure provisioning system that enables consistent, automated environment creation across development, testing, and production stages.

## Project Overview

Modern software development requires reliable, reproducible environments. This project teaches infrastructure automation, configuration management, and deployment strategies through hands-on implementation of a provisioning toolset.

- Production deployments need reliable, repeatable processes

### Learning Objectives
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Configuration management strategies
- Container orchestration and virtualization
- Cloud platform integration
- Security and compliance automation
- Monitoring and observability setup
